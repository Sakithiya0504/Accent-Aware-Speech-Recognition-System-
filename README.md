# Accent-Aware-Speech-Recognition-System-
The goal of this project is to develop an accent-aware ASR system that leverages deep learning models (CNNs and RNNs), speaker adaptation techniques (e.g., MLLR), and data augmentation strategies to improve recognition accuracy across different accents and dialects.
